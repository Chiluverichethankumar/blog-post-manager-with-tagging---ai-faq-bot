    # --- Python ---
    "What is Python?": "Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability.",
    "What are Python data types?": "Common Python data types include int, float, str, bool, list, tuple, set, and dict.",
    "What is a Python list?": "A list is a mutable, ordered collection of items, defined using square brackets [].",
    "What is a Python dictionary?": "A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs defined using curly braces {}.",
    "What is a function in Python?": "A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task and is defined using the 'def' keyword.",
    "What are Python decorators?": "Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of other functions or methods using the @ syntax.",
    "What is the difference between '==' and 'is' in Python?": "'==' checks value equality, while 'is' checks if two variables point to the same object in memory.",
    "What is list comprehension?": "List comprehension is a concise way to create lists using a single line of code.",
    "What is a lambda function?": "A lambda function is an anonymous function defined with the lambda keyword, useful for short, throwaway functions.",
    "How is exception handling done in Python?": "Exception handling uses try-except blocks to catch and handle errors gracefully.",
    "What is the use of the 'with' statement in Python?": "It simplifies exception handling and automatically manages resources, like opening and closing files.",

    # --- SQL ---
    "What is SQL?": "SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is used to manage and query relational databases.",
    "What are SQL joins?": "Joins combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. Types: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN.",
    "What is a primary key in SQL?": "A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table and cannot contain NULL values.",
    "What is a foreign key?": "A foreign key is a column that creates a relationship between two tables.",
    "What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING in SQL?": "'WHERE' filters rows before grouping, 'HAVING' filters groups after aggregation.",
    "What are aggregate functions in SQL?": "Aggregate functions operate on sets of values and return a single result. Examples: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN.",
    "What is a subquery in SQL?": "A subquery is a query nested inside another query. It can be used in SELECT, FROM, or WHERE clauses.",
    "What is normalization in SQL?": "Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity.",
    "What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE in SQL?": "'DELETE' removes rows based on a condition and can be rolled back. 'TRUNCATE' removes all rows and is faster, but can't be rolled back in most DBs.",
    "How do you handle NULL values in SQL?": "Use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL in conditions. Functions like COALESCE or IFNULL help replace NULL values.",

    # --- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) ---
    "What is EDA?": "EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis, which involves understanding the dataset through summary statistics and visualization.",
    "What are common steps in EDA?": "Common steps include: 1) understanding data structure, 2) checking for missing values, 3) identifying outliers, 4) plotting distributions.",
    "What libraries are used for EDA in Python?": "Popular libraries include Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.",
    "How do you handle missing values in a dataset?": "You can drop them, fill them with mean/median/mode, or use more advanced imputation techniques.",
    "What is correlation in EDA?": "Correlation measures the relationship between two variables. Pearson correlation is commonly used.",
    "How to visualize distributions?": "Use histograms, KDE plots, or box plots to understand the distribution of a variable.",
    "What is a box plot?": "A box plot shows the distribution of data based on quartiles and highlights outliers.",
    "What is an outlier?": "An outlier is a data point that is significantly different from others. It can distort analysis if not handled.",
    "What is the purpose of a heatmap in EDA?": "A heatmap is used to visualize correlation or frequency matrices using colors for better insight.",
    "What is feature engineering in EDA?": "Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance."
